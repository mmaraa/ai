# Artificial Intelligence notebooks

I have included to this repository some of my artificial intelligence notebooks that I have used to learn Azure Open AI. Those are not following all best practices and those are for the demonstration purposes only. If you like those, leave star to the repository and feel free to propose edits.

## Notebooks

| Notebook      | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chat_Basics   | Single question to the model to test the connectivity                                                |
| Chat_Local_CSV | Use local CSV as a data source. This is more to understand the concept of embedding instead of using the "external data source". |
| Chat_UsingVectorDB | Use pre-created vector database as a data source with keyword or vector based query type. |
